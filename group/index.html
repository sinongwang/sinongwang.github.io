    <h3>Hashing Baseline for Image Retrieval</h3>
    <p><strong>My role:</strong> Project Owner</p>
    <p>I do the image retrieval research in early 2013. My mission is to design efficient hashing algorithm to map the semantic similar images to the similar codes. There are two main advantages using hashing method for image retrieval, i.e. storage and computation efficience. To let more researchers focus on design hashing algorithm, I have built a hashing baseline, hoping this project can do some help for some researchers. </p>
