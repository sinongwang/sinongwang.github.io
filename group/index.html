  Here are my projects. Some of them are my academy research, some are just my interest.
  <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr>?

    <h2><a href="{{ product.url }}">标题HABIR</a></h2>
    <h3>详细标题Hashing Baseline for Image Retrieval</h3>
    <p><strong>My role:</strong> 我是干什么的Project Owner</p>
    <p>这个项目干什么的I do the image retrieval research in early 2013. My mission is to design efficient hashing algorithm to map the semantic similar images to the similar codes. There are two main advantages using hashing method for image retrieval, i.e. storage and computation efficience. To let more researchers focus on design hashing algorithm, I have built a hashing baseline, hoping this project can do some help for some researchers. </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Technologies:</strong> 用到了什么Matlab, Hashing, Image Retrieval
