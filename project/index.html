    <h2><a href="">Wireless Caching Network</a></h2>
    <h3>Coded Cache</h3>
    <p>Recent studies show that the coded caching technique can facilitate the wireless content distribution by mitigating
the wireless traffic volume during the peak-traffic time, where
the contents are partially prefetched to the local cache of mobile
devices during the off-peak time. The remaining contents are
then jointly coded and delivered in multicast, when many content
requests are initiated in the peak-traffic time. The requested
contents can be recovered from the local-prefetched and multicast
data with requesters experiencing less congestions. </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Targets:</strong> I have discovered four orientations: (1) investigating order-optimal coded cacching scheme under nonuniform user demands; (2)investigating coded cache scheme under nonuniform user demands and dynamic content popularity; (3)investigating the trade-off between traffic and delay when considering the coded cache scheme and other multicasting scheme; (4) investigating the efficiency of coded caching scheme when considering the channel sata information or channel distribution information. 
    </p>
     <p>
      <strong>Results:</strong> I have completed the invetigation of the first three orientations and submitted three research papers.

    <h2><a href="">Data Center Network</a></h2>
    <h3>Virtual Maching Placement</h3>
    <p>With the spectrum of application paradigm for the data center services continuing to extend, efficient resource management within the data center becomes more important. One of the key technologies to this problem is virtualization, which improves the resource utilizations, scalabilities, flexibilities and availabilities of applications. Based on the virtualization technology, individual physical machines(PMs) can be carved into multiple virtual machines(VMs), each of which grantees its required resource by slicing a portion of resources from PM. As a result, infrastructure provider just need to regard these VMs as basic deployment and management unit instead of PMs to efficiently manage the resources within the data center. However, a core challenge at the infrastructure level is the placement of the VMs on PMs. </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Target:</strong> designing a single-objective model to achieve combining profits of three objectives: maximizing resource utilization, minimizing the traffic load and balancing the multidimensional utilization.

      <strong>Result:</strong> I have published this work in the IEEE NAS 2013.

    <h3>Resource Allocation in Hybrid Data Center</h3>
    <p>Recently online services are applied into many aspects of
our daily life. For example, people perform communication,
shopping, entertainment and professional activities over the
Internet. The Online Service Providers (OSPs) need to develop new technologies, aiming at providing QoS guaranteed
service while at the same time, minimizing its operating cost.
Often times, an OSP operates a number of distinct services
simultaneously, so it needs to answer requests from various
applications that differ a lot in pattern. To this end, many OSPs
develop private cloud systems so as to provide virtualized
environment where each service can be properly addressed. </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Target:</strong>  designing a hybrid cloud approach, where routine requests are
normally addressed by local private cloud, while a third-party
public cloud is needed when there is a burst of incoming requests.
Our goal is to answer 1) from the online service provider’s
perspective, how to decide the local private cloud resource
allocation, and how to distribute the incoming requests to private
and/or public clouds; and 2) from the public cloud provider’s
perspective, how to decide the optimal prices to sell these public
cloud resources so as to maximize its profit.

      <strong>Result:</strong> We have submitted one research paper to INFOCOM 2015.

    <h2><a href="">Cognative Radio</a></h2>
    <h3>Double Spectrum Auctions</h3>
    <p>Auction is often applied in cognitive radio networks
due to its efficiency and fairness properties. An important issue
in designing an auction mechanism is how to utilize the limited
spectrum resource in an efficient manner. In order to achieve
this goal, we propose a predictive double spectrum auction
model in this paper. Our auction model first obtains the bidding
range from statistical analysis, and then separates the interval
into independent states and employees a Markovian prediction
based algorithm to generate guidelines for the bidding range
of primary and secondary users, respectively. Comparing withc
existing approaches, our proposed auction model is more efficient
in spectrum utilization and satisfies the economic properties.
Extensive simulation results show that our work achieves an
utilization ratio up to 91%. </p>

      <strong>Result:</strong> We have published one research paper in Globecom 2014.

    <h3>Broadcast Channel Capacity</h3>
    <p>Superposition code is a technique that can achieve the capacity region for downlink channle when each user only has private or common information. We consider the case that each user may has the private information and partial-common information</p>
