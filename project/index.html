    <h2><a href="">Wireless Caching Network</a></h2>
    <h3>Coded Cache</h3>
    <p>Recent studies show that the coded caching technique can facilitate the wireless content distribution by mitigating
the wireless traffic volume during the peak-traffic time, where
the contents are partially prefetched to the local cache of mobile
devices during the off-peak time. The remaining contents are
then jointly coded and delivered in multicast, when many content
requests are initiated in the peak-traffic time. The requested
contents can be recovered from the local-prefetched and multicast
data with requesters experiencing less congestions. </p>
<p>
      <strong>Target:</strong> I have discovered four orientations: 1) investigating order-optimal coded cacching scheme under nonuniform user demands; 2)investigating coded cache scheme under nonuniform user demands and dynamic content popularity; 3)investigating the trade-off between traffic and delay when considering the coded cache scheme and other multicasting scheme; 4) investigating the efficiency of coded caching scheme when considering the channel sata information or channel distribution information.
